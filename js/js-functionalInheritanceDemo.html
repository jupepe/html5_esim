<div><a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/private.html">Functional inheritance</a> in JavaScript by Douglas Crockford.<br> 
The following is an example in the style of the functional pattern for inheritance from the following Book: <b>Douglas Crockford's JavaScript: The Good Parts</b></div>

<script>

var phone = function(spec) {
  var that = {};

  that.getPhoneNumber = function() {
    return spec.phoneNumber;
  };

  that.getDescription = function() {
    return "This is a phone that can make calls.";

var smartPhone = function(spec) {
  var that = phone(spec);
  spec.signature = spec.signature || "sent from " + that.getPhoneNumber();

  that.sendEmail = function(emailAddress, message) {
    console.log(emailAddress + message + "," + spec.signature);
  };
  
  var super_getDescription = that.getDescription();
  
  that.getDescription = function() {
    return super_getDescription +  " Smart phone can also send email messages.";
  };

  return that;

// Instances of each of these types could be created and used as follows:

var myPhone = phone({"phoneNumber": "8675309"});
var mySmartPhone = smartPhone({"phoneNumber": "5555555", "signature": "Adios"});
mySmartPhone.sendEmail("noone@example.com", "I can send email from my phone!");
